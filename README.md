# 🚀 MLOps Playbook

---

## Overview

**MLOps Playbook** is a comprehensive, production-focused repository that documents my journey in building, deploying, and maintaining real-world machine learning systems.

This repository serves as:

- A **personal knowledge base** for MLOps concepts  
- A **portfolio of real-world projects**  
- A **reference guide** for tools, architecture, and best practices  
- A **demonstration of engineering maturity** in ML systems  

The goal is to bridge the gap between **machine learning models** and **reliable, scalable, and observable production systems**.
